Dwibbble - 0.1
Written by Joshua Lee Tucker for Stunnify.

Clearing some things up...
==========================

A 'player' is a Dribbble user.
A 'shot' is a design that player uploads to Dribbble.
A 'rebound' is a response to a shot that a player has uploaded to Dribbble.

How to use Dwibbble
===================

Dwibbble uses the SystemConfiguration framework to check for a connection to the internet. The first thing you need to do is add SystemConfiguration.framework to your project. (Otherwise Dwibbble will not build).

Dwibbble uses a delegate protocol which helps to keep everything very clean and simple. You NEVER have to (nor should) create anything but a Dwibbble object (no DwibbblePlayer or DwibbbleShot objects).
